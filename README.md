## Setup

To init a project folder with the necessary files, run the command:

```bash
npx vitron@latest init
```

This will create the following files/directories, if they do not already exist:

- src
    - entrypoint
        - index.ts
    - renderer
        - index.js
        - index.html
- .electron-builder.yml

The default location of the `entrypoint` and `renderer` directory can
be changed with a configuration file in the root directory  of the project.

Therefore, create a `vitron.config.js` file in the root folder with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    port: 9000,
    
    entrypointDirectory: 'src/entrypoint',
    
    rendererDirectory: 'src/renderer',
}
```

## Usage

In a project where Vitron is installed, the vitron binary can be used as npm script.
Alternatively run it directly with `npx vitron`. 
Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vitron project:

The best way to use the following commands, is by creating shortcuts in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "vitron dev",
        "build": "vitron build"
    }
}
```
