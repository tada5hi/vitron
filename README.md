**Important NOTE**

The `README.md` file is under construction ‚òÇ at the moment.
So please stay patient or contribute to it, till it covers all parts ‚≠ê.

## Usage

The best way to use the following commands, is by creating shortcuts in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "init": "vitron init",
        "dev": "vitron dev",
        "build": "vitron build"
    }
}
```

### Init

To init the project folder with the necessary files, run the command:

```bash
npm run init
```

**or**

```bash
vitron init
```

This will create the following files/directories, if they do not already exist:

- src
  - entrypoint
    - index.ts
  - renderer
    - index.js
    - index.html
- .electron-builder.yml
- tsconfig.json

The default location of the `entrypoint` and `renderer` directory can 
be changed with a configuration file in the root directory  of the project.

Therefore, create a `.vitron.yml` file in the root folder with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    port: 9000,
    
    entrypointDirectory: 'src/entrypoint',
    
    rendererDirectory: 'src/renderer',
}
```

### Dev

To run the application in development mode, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

```bash
npm run dev
```

**or**

```bash
vitron dev
```

### Build

To build the application for an operating system, run the following command.

```bash
npm run build
```

**or**

```bash
vitron build
```
