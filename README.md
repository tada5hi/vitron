**Important NOTE**

The `README.md` file is under construction ‚òÇ at the moment.
So please stay patient or contribute to it, till it covers all parts ‚≠ê.

## Usage

The best way to use the following commands, is by creating shortcuts in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "init": "electron-adapter init",
        "dev": "electron-adapter dev",
        "build": "electron-adapter build"
    }
}
```

### Init

To init the project folder with the necessary files, run the command:

```bash
npm run init
```

**or**

```bash
electron-adapter init
```

This will create the following files/directories, if they do not already exist:

**Directories**
- entrypoint
- src

**Files**
- .electron-builder.yml
- tsconfig.json
- entrypoint/index.ts
- src/index.js
- src/index.html

The `entrypoint` & `src` path and other specifications, 
can be changed with a configuration file in the root directory  of the project.

Therefore, create a `.electron-adapter.yml` file in the root folder with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    port: 9000,
    
    // framework: 'nuxt' | 'next',
    
    // rootPath: '',
    
    // buildDirectory: 'dist',
    
    entrypointDirectory: 'entrypoint',
    // entrypointWebpack: undefined, 
    
    rendererDirectory: 'src',
    // rendererWebpack: undefined, 
}
```

### Dev

To run the application in development mode, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

```bash
npm run dev
```

**or**

```bash
electron-adapter dev
```

### Build

To build the application for an operating system, run the following command.

```bash
npm run build
```

**or**

```bash
electron-adapter build
```
