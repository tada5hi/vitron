## Installation

```bash
npm install --save vitron
```

## Setup

To init a project folder with the necessary files, run the command:

```bash
npx vitron@latest init
```

This will create the following files/directories, if they do not already exist:

- src
    - entrypoint
        - index.ts
    - renderer
        - index.js
        - index.html
- .electron-builder.yml

After the directory structure has been created, 
the dependencies must be installed using a package manager like npm, pnpm, .... In the following example, npm is used:

```bash
npm install
```

The default location of the `entrypoint` and `renderer` directory can
be changed with a configuration file in the root directory  of the project.

Therefore, create a `vitron.config.js` file in the root folder with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    port: 9000,
    
    entrypointDirectory: 'src/entrypoint',
    
    rendererDirectory: 'src/renderer',
}
```

### Frameworks

Various frontend frameworks, such as `Nuxt.js` and `Next.js`, can be used out of the box and do not require any special configuration üéâ. 
The framework files only need to be placed in the `rendererDirectory`.

## Usage

In a project where Vitron is installed, the vitron binary can be used as npm script.
Alternatively run it directly with `npx vitron`. 
Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vitron project:

The best way to use the following commands, is by creating shortcuts in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "vitron dev",
        "build": "vitron build"
    }
}
```
